# Udacity-behaviorial-cloning-data
Data collected by using udacity self-driving car simulator to train behavioral cloning algorithm
Simulator was downloaded from following link: https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim
I am using window version 2 simulator


1.	Vehicle was driven as close as possible in center of lane.
2.	To remove bias for turning in one direction, additional data was recorded by driving vehicle in reverse/opposite direction.
3.	Three laps of data was collected in both direction
4.	Additional recovery laps data was collected by starting off lane and maneuvering back to center.
